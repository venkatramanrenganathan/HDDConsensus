# History Data-Driven Distributed Consensus for Networks
This repository contains the code for simulating the History Data Driven (HDD) Distributed Consensus Protocol in networks. The code in this repository is built towards designing simulations for our paper titled "History Data Driven Distributed Consensus in Networks", submitted to the IFAC NECSYS 2022 Conference, Zurich.

# Procedure to run the code
- Download the export fig package from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig
- Add the path to the folder containing the code from the export package
- Run the main.m by setting loaddata = 0, saveData = 1.
- Run the main.m again by setting loaddata = 1 to plot and save the figures
